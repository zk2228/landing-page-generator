# RevitalizeMe Brand Voice Guide

## The Core Voice

**Who we sound like:** A smart friend who happens to be a doctor. Confident without being arrogant. Clear without being condescending. Empathetic without being soft.

**Who we don't sound like:** 
- Corporate healthcare ("your wellness journey partner")
- Bro-science influencer ("trust me bro, this works")
- Academic journal (inaccessible jargon)
- Scared lawyer (disclaimer soup)

## Voice Attributes

### 1. DIRECT
We get to the point. Patients are Googling because they want answers.

❌ "Many individuals find themselves wondering about the various options that might be available for addressing concerns related to weight management."

✅ "Weight loss medications work. Here's how to know if they're right for you."

### 2. CREDIBLE
We cite sources. We name mechanisms. We don't hide behind vague claims.

❌ "Studies show this might help some people."

✅ "A 2023 NEJM study found Semaglutide patients lost an average of 15% body weight over 68 weeks."

### 3. EMPATHETIC
We understand these topics are personal. We don't shame. We don't minimize.

❌ "If you'd just exercise more, you wouldn't need medication."

✅ "Weight loss is complex — genetics, hormones, and lifestyle all play a role. Medication can be one effective tool in your approach."

### 4. PRACTICAL
We give people something to do with the information.

❌ "Hormone optimization is an emerging field with many considerations."

✅ "Here's how to know if your testosterone levels warrant a conversation with a provider — and what that conversation should cover."

### 5. HONEST ABOUT LIMITATIONS
We build trust by admitting what we don't know or can't do.

❌ "Our treatments will solve your hair loss."

✅ "Finasteride works for most men — about 80-90% see results. It works best for maintaining what you have. If you've been losing hair for years, expectations should be realistic."

### Medical Terms: Explain, Don't Avoid

❌ "GLP-1 agonists affect satiety signals."

✅ "GLP-1 medications (like Semaglutide) work by mimicking a hormone that tells your brain you're full."

---

## Sentence Structure

**Short sentences for impact.** Long sentences for nuance.

Mix them.

Like this:

"Hair loss affects 50 million men in the US. It's not just cosmetic — for many, it's tied to confidence, identity, and how they show up in the world. That's worth addressing. Here's what actually works."

---

## Paragraph Structure

- Lead with the point
- Support with evidence or example
- End with implication or next step

**Example:**

"Semaglutide isn't a shortcut — it's a tool. [point] Clinical trials show patients lose 15% of body weight on average, but they also follow nutrition guidance and increase activity. [evidence] The medication makes those changes easier to sustain. [implication]"

---

## Headlines & Hooks

**Headlines should:**
- Lead with benefit or outcome
- Include specificity (numbers, conditions, mechanisms)
- Avoid clickbait that over-promises

**Examples:**

❌ "Everything You Need to Know About Weight Loss"
✅ "GLP-1 Medications Explained: How Semaglutide Actually Works"

❌ "Hair Loss Solutions That Work"
✅ "Finasteride vs. Minoxidil: Which Works Better (And Can You Use Both?)"

❌ "Big News About Marijuana"
✅ "Marijuana Moved to Schedule III: What This Means for Medical Patients"

---

## The Compliance Gut-Check

Before publishing, ask:

1. Would a provider be comfortable with their name on this?
2. Does it promise outcomes we can't guarantee?
3. Does it diagnose without a consultation?
4. Would the FDA flag any claims?
5. Is the disclaimer present but not doing all the work?

If any answer is "yes" or "maybe" — revise.

## Brand Voice in Practice

**Topic: ED Treatments**

❌ Too clinical:
"Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors function by enhancing nitric oxide pathways to facilitate penile erection through smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum."

❌ Too casual:
"Can't get it up? No worries bro, these pills fix that."

✅ RevitalizeMe voice:
"ED medications like Sildenafil work by increasing blood flow when you're aroused — they don't create arousal on their own. Most men see results within 30-60 minutes. They're safe for most people, though a provider should review your heart health and current medications first."
