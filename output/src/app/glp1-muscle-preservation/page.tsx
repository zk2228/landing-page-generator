              You have probably seen the headlines. &ldquo;GLP-1 drugs are eating your muscle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ozempic face is destroying your body.&rdquo; &ldquo;The hidden danger of weight loss drugs.&rdquo;
            </p>

            The Number That Started the Panic
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              When you lose weight &mdash; through any method &mdash; you lose a combination of fat and lean mass. Lean mass includes muscle, but it also includes organs, bone, fluids, and water stored in fat tissue. This is not unique to GLP-1 medications. It happens with dieting. It happens after bariatric surgery. It happens any time your body is in a sustained caloric deficit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the STEP 1 and SURMOUNT-1 clinical trials, body composition data showed that lean mass accounted for roughly 25 to 40 percent of total weight lost. That range sounds alarming until you understand what it actually means.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2024 network meta-analysis across 22 randomized controlled trials found that GLP-1 medications reduced lean mass by approximately 25 percent of total weight lost &mdash; but critically, the percentage of lean mass relative to total body weight remained unchanged. In plain English: you lose some lean mass, but your body composition ratio stays similar or improves because you are losing proportionally more fat.
            </p>
            <p>
              A UC Davis research team put it more bluntly. Much of the reported 40 percent lean mass loss with GLP-1 use is coming from the liver, not from skeletal muscle. When your liver shrinks because it is no longer storing excess fat, that registers as lean mass loss on a DEXA scan. Your biceps did not disappear. Your liver got healthier.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section 2: Why This Matters More Than Headlines Suggest */}

            Why This Matters More Than Headlines Suggest
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              The real concern is not lean mass loss in general. It is skeletal muscle loss specifically &mdash; the muscle that moves your body, supports your joints, maintains your metabolic rate, and protects you as you age. And here, the picture is more nuanced than the panic suggests.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2025 review in Circulation examined whether muscle changes during GLP-1 treatment are &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; (a normal physiological response to carrying less weight) or &ldquo;maladaptive&rdquo; (harmful muscle wasting). Their conclusion: the evidence suggests the changes are adaptive. When you lose 50 or 70 pounds, your body does not need the same amount of muscle to move through the world. Some reduction in muscle volume is your body recalibrating &mdash; not deteriorating.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same review noted that GLP-1 medications improve insulin sensitivity, and insulin plays a key role in muscle protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance &mdash; which affects most people with obesity &mdash; actually contributes to poor muscle quality. By improving insulin sensitivity, GLP-1 treatment may improve the quality of the muscle you retain, even if the total volume decreases slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, this is not a reason to be complacent. Muscle matters enormously for long-term health, metabolic rate, mobility, and aging. The question is not whether to worry about it &mdash; it is what to do about it.
            </p>

          {/* Section 3: The Glucagon Advantage */}
          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl sm:text-[28px] text-[#294547] mb-6">
            The Glucagon Advantage: Why Retatrutide May Change This Equation
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              Current GLP-1 medications (semaglutide) and dual agonists (tirzepatide) work primarily by reducing appetite. You eat less, your body enters a caloric deficit, and you lose weight. The caloric deficit is what drives muscle loss &mdash; not the drugs themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Retatrutide introduces a third mechanism that current medications lack: glucagon receptor activation. In preclinical trials, retatrutide promoted preferential fat burning over lean mass loss. The glucagon receptor increases energy expenditure &mdash; meaning your body burns more calories at rest &mdash; and mobilizes fat stores for fuel rather than breaking down muscle tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Phase 2 obesity trial, retatrutide achieved 24.2 percent weight loss at the highest dose, and the weight loss was primarily due to reductions in fat mass with less impact on lean mass. That distinction matters. If confirmed in Phase 3 trials, retatrutide could represent the first weight loss medication that actively shifts the composition of weight loss toward fat and away from muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is still investigational. Retatrutide is not FDA-approved and cannot be prescribed outside of clinical trials. But it is worth understanding why the glucagon receptor matters for muscle preservation, because it changes the strategic calculus for patients considering treatment.

            Five Strategies You Can Start Today
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              Whether you are on semaglutide, tirzepatide, or any weight loss program, these five strategies are supported by current evidence and recommended by the medical community. They are listed in order of impact.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Strategy 1 */}
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-8">
            1. Prioritize Protein &mdash; and Hit Your Number
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              This is the single most important thing you can do to preserve muscle during weight loss. Current evidence supports 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day during active weight loss on GLP-1 medications. For a 200-pound person, that translates to roughly 110 to 180 grams of protein daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is that GLP-1 medications reduce your appetite. You are eating less overall, which means you need to be intentional about making protein a larger proportion of what you do eat. This is not about eating more food &mdash; it is about changing the ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practical targets:</strong> aim for 30 to 40 grams of protein at each meal. Prioritize complete protein sources &mdash; eggs, poultry, fish, dairy, legumes. If you are struggling to hit your numbers, a high-quality protein supplement can fill the gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Mass General Brigham review found that combining a high-protein diet with consistent exercise during GLP-1 treatment had the greatest benefit in preserving bone and muscle mass &mdash; better than either strategy alone.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Strategy 2 */}
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-8">
            2. Resistance Train Two to Four Times Per Week
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              This is non-negotiable. Resistance training is the most powerful signal you can send your body to preserve muscle during weight loss. It tells your muscles: you are still needed. Keep building. Do not break down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously: squats, deadlifts, rows, presses, lunges. These exercises recruit the most muscle fiber and produce the strongest preservation signal.
            </p>
            <p>
              You do not need to train like a competitive lifter. Two to four sessions per week of 30 to 45 minutes is sufficient. The key is consistency over intensity. Progressive overload &mdash; gradually increasing the weight or reps over time &mdash; keeps the muscle-preserving stimulus strong as your body adapts.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are new to resistance training, start with bodyweight movements or machines. A qualified trainer can build a program specific to your situation. The investment pays for itself in preserved metabolic rate alone.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Strategy 3 */}
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-8">
            3. Do Not Undereat
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              This seems counterintuitive during a weight loss program, but it is critically important. GLP-1 medications can suppress appetite so effectively that some patients eat dangerously little &mdash; sometimes under 800 calories per day. At that level of restriction, your body will break down muscle for energy regardless of how much protein you consume or how often you train.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work with your provider to ensure your caloric intake stays in a moderate deficit range. The medication handles appetite reduction. You handle making sure the food you do eat is nutrient-dense and protein-rich. Extreme restriction does not accelerate results &mdash; it accelerates muscle loss.

            4. Monitor Body Composition, Not Just Weight
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              The scale tells you one number. It cannot tell you whether you lost five pounds of fat or five pounds of muscle. For patients on GLP-1 medications, tracking body composition is far more meaningful than tracking weight alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Options range from simple to clinical. Waist-to-hip ratio measurements at home give you a rough directional indicator. Bioelectrical impedance scales (available for under $50) provide estimates of body fat percentage. For the most accurate picture, ask your provider about DEXA scans, which can measure fat mass, lean mass, and bone density separately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is not a specific weight. The goal is losing fat while retaining muscle. Those are different objectives, and they require different measurements.

          {/* Strategy 5 */}
          <h3 className="text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-8">
            5. Consider Creatine
          </h3>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              Creatine monohydrate is one of the most studied supplements in sports science, with decades of safety data. It supports muscle energy production, may improve strength output during resistance training, and has emerging evidence for cognitive benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              For patients on GLP-1 medications who are actively resistance training, creatine supplementation (3 to 5 grams daily) may provide additional muscle preservation support. It is inexpensive, widely available, and has no known interactions with GLP-1 medications.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a magic bullet. It is a small edge that compounds over time &mdash; and it only works if you are already doing the first four strategies.

            The Bigger Picture: Muscle Is Your Metabolic Engine
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              Here is why all of this matters beyond aesthetics. Muscle is the largest glucose-disposal organ in your body. It is responsible for a significant portion of your resting metabolic rate. It protects your joints, supports your spine, and is the single strongest predictor of physical independence as you age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preserving muscle during weight loss is not about looking a certain way. It is about ensuring that the weight you lose stays lost. Patients who lose significant muscle mass during weight loss have lower metabolic rates afterward, which makes weight regain more likely. Patients who preserve muscle maintain a higher metabolic rate and have better long-term outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where the combination of medical treatment and lifestyle intervention produces results that neither can achieve alone. The medication handles appetite and metabolic signaling. You handle the resistance training and protein. Your provider handles the monitoring and dose optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              The weight loss medication landscape is evolving fast. Today&apos;s medications work. Tomorrow&apos;s &mdash; like retatrutide &mdash; may work even better at preserving the muscle that matters most. But regardless of which medication you use, the five strategies above are your foundation.
