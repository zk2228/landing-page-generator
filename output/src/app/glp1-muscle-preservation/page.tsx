            The Number That Started the Panic
          </h2>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              When you lose weight &mdash; through any method &mdash; you lose a combination of fat and lean mass. Lean mass includes muscle, but it also includes organs, bone, fluids, and water stored in fat tissue. This is not unique to GLP-1 medications. It happens with dieting. It happens after bariatric surgery. It happens any time your body is in a sustained caloric deficit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the STEP 1 and SURMOUNT-1 clinical trials, body composition data showed that lean mass accounted for roughly 25 to 40 percent of total weight lost. That range sounds alarming until you understand what it actually means.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2024 network meta-analysis across 22 randomized controlled trials found that GLP-1 medications reduced lean mass by approximately 25 percent of total weight lost &mdash; but critically, the percentage of lean mass relative to total body weight remained unchanged. In plain English: you lose some lean mass, but your body composition ratio stays similar or improves because you are losing proportionally more fat.
            </p>
            <p>
              A UC Davis research team put it more bluntly. Much of the reported 40 percent lean mass loss with GLP-1 use is coming from the liver, not from skeletal muscle. When your liver shrinks because it is no longer storing excess fat, that registers as lean mass loss on a DEXA scan. Your biceps did not disappear. Your liver got healthier.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Section: Why This Matters */}
          <h2 className="w-full font-display text-2xl sm:text-[28px] text-[#294547] mb-6">
            Why This Matters More Than Headlines Suggest
          </h2>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              The real concern is not lean mass loss in general. It is skeletal muscle loss specifically &mdash; the muscle that moves your body, supports your joints, maintains your metabolic rate, and protects you as you age.
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2025 review in Circulation examined whether muscle changes during GLP-1 treatment are &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; (a normal physiological response to carrying less weight) or &ldquo;maladaptive&rdquo; (harmful muscle wasting). Their conclusion: the evidence suggests the changes are adaptive.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same review noted that GLP-1 medications improve insulin sensitivity, and insulin plays a key role in muscle protein synthesis. By improving insulin sensitivity, GLP-1 treatment may improve the quality of the muscle you retain, even if the total volume decreases slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, this is not a reason to be complacent. Muscle matters enormously for long-term health, metabolic rate, mobility, and aging. The question is not whether to worry about it &mdash; it is what to do about it.
            </p>

          {/* Section: The Glucagon Advantage */}
          <h2 className="w-full font-display text-2xl sm:text-[28px] text-[#294547] mb-6">
            The Glucagon Advantage: Why Retatrutide May Change This Equation
          </h2>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-10">
            <p>
              Current GLP-1 medications (semaglutide) and dual agonists (tirzepatide) work primarily by reducing appetite. You eat less, your body enters a caloric deficit, and you lose weight. The caloric deficit is what drives muscle loss &mdash; not the drugs themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Retatrutide introduces a third mechanism that current medications lack: glucagon receptor activation. In preclinical trials, retatrutide promoted preferential fat burning over lean mass loss. The glucagon receptor increases energy expenditure &mdash; meaning your body burns more calories at rest &mdash; and mobilizes fat stores for fuel rather than breaking down muscle tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Phase 2 obesity trial, retatrutide achieved 24.2 percent weight loss at the highest dose, and the weight loss was primarily due to reductions in fat mass with less impact on lean mass. If confirmed in Phase 3 trials, retatrutide could represent the first weight loss medication that actively shifts the composition of weight loss toward fat and away from muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is still investigational. Retatrutide is not FDA-approved and cannot be prescribed outside of clinical trials. But it is worth understanding why the glucagon receptor matters for muscle preservation, because it changes the strategic calculus for patients considering treatment.

          {/* Section: Five Strategies */}

            Five Strategies You Can Start Today
          </h2>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <p>
              Whether you are on semaglutide, tirzepatide, or any weight loss program, these five strategies are supported by current evidence and recommended by the medical community. They are listed in order of impact.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="w-full text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-6">
            1. Prioritize Protein &mdash; and Hit Your Number
          </h3>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <p>
              This is the single most important thing you can do to preserve muscle during weight loss. Current evidence supports 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day during active weight loss on GLP-1 medications. For a 200-pound person, that translates to roughly 110 to 180 grams of protein daily.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is that GLP-1 medications reduce your appetite. You are eating less overall, which means you need to be intentional about making protein a larger proportion of what you do eat.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Practical targets:</strong> aim for 30 to 40 grams of protein at each meal. Prioritize complete protein sources &mdash; eggs, poultry, fish, dairy, legumes. If you are struggling to hit your numbers, a high-quality protein supplement can fill the gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Mass General Brigham review found that combining a high-protein diet with consistent exercise during GLP-1 treatment had the greatest benefit in preserving bone and muscle mass &mdash; better than either strategy alone.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="w-full text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-6">
            2. Resistance Train Two to Four Times Per Week
          </h3>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <p>
              This is non-negotiable. Resistance training is the most powerful signal you can send your body to preserve muscle during weight loss. Focus on compound movements: squats, deadlifts, rows, presses, lunges. Two to four sessions per week of 30 to 45 minutes is sufficient. The key is consistency over intensity.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are new to resistance training, start with bodyweight movements or machines. A qualified trainer can build a program specific to your situation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="w-full text-lg sm:text-xl font-semibold text-[#294547] mb-3 mt-6">
            3. Do Not Undereat
          </h3>
          <div className="w-full space-y-5 text-[#1A1A2E] text-base sm:text-[17px] leading-relaxed mb-8">
            <p>
              GLP-1 medications can suppress appetite so effectively that some patients eat dangerously little &mdash; sometimes under 800 calories per day. At that level of restriction, your body will break down muscle for energy regardless of how much protein you consume or how often you train.
            </p>
            <p>
              Work with your provider to ensure your caloric intake stays in a moderate deficit range. Extreme restriction does not accelerate results &mdash; it accelerates muscle loss.

            4. Monitor Body Composition, Not Just Weight

            <p>
              The scale tells you one number. It cannot tell you whether you lost five pounds of fat or five pounds of muscle. For patients on GLP-1 medications, tracking body composition is far more meaningful than tracking weight alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Options range from simple to clinical. Waist-to-hip ratio measurements at home give you a rough directional indicator. Bioelectrical impedance scales provide estimates of body fat percentage. For the most accurate picture, ask your provider about DEXA scans.
            </p>

              Creatine monohydrate is one of the most studied supplements in sports science, with decades of safety data. For patients on GLP-1 medications who are actively resistance training, creatine supplementation (3 to 5 grams daily) may provide additional muscle preservation support.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a magic bullet. It is a small edge that compounds over time &mdash; and it only works if you are already doing the first four strategies.

              Muscle is the largest glucose-disposal organ in your body. It is responsible for a significant portion of your resting metabolic rate. It protects your joints, supports your spine, and is the single strongest predictor of physical independence as you age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Preserving muscle during weight loss is not about looking a certain way. It is about ensuring that the weight you lose stays lost. Patients who preserve muscle maintain a higher metabolic rate and have better long-term outcomes.

              The weight loss medication landscape is evolving fast. Today&apos;s medications work. Tomorrow&apos;s &mdash; like retatrutide &mdash; may work even better at preserving the muscle that matters most. But regardless of which medication you use, the five strategies above are your foundation.
