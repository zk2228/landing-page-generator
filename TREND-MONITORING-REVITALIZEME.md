## What RevitalizeMe Should NOT React To

❌ **Political debates** — even if health-related, stay neutral
❌ **Celebrity drama** — unless directly educational opportunity
❌ **Competitor attacks** — never dunk, even if they mess up
❌ **Unverified claims** — wait for confirmation
❌ **Patient horror stories** — don't amplify fear
❌ **Off-brand memes** — forced relevance is cringe

**The test:** Would our providers be comfortable with this? If not, skip.
