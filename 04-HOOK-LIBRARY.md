## HOOK FORMULAS

### Formula 1: Stat + Implication
```
[Specific statistic]. [What it means for you].
```

**Examples:**
- "15% of body weight. That's what Semaglutide patients lost on average — more than any lifestyle intervention alone."
- "80-90% of men see results from Finasteride. But timing matters more than most people realize."
- "64 million Americans used cannabis last year. The federal government just acknowledged what they already knew."
- "6 in 10 medical marijuana patients use it for pain. The FDA now recognizes that's legitimate."

### Formula 2: Myth Bust
```
You've heard [common belief]. [Reality is different].
```

**Examples:**
- "You've heard you need to eat less to lose weight. Your hormones have a different opinion."
- "You've heard hair loss is genetic and inevitable. It is genetic. It's not inevitable."
- "You've heard ED is psychological. For most men, it's vascular. Here's why that's good news."
- "You've heard CBD is unregulated snake oil. The research is more interesting than that."

### Formula 3: Direct Answer
```
[Question]. [Answer]. [But there's context].
```

**Examples:**
- "Does Semaglutide actually work? Yes. But 'work' means different things to different people."
- "Can you get Finasteride online? Yes — if you qualify after a provider evaluation."
- "Is marijuana legal now? Not exactly. Here's what Schedule III actually changes."
- "Do peptides work for anti-aging? Some do. Most don't. Here's how to tell the difference."

### Formula 4: The Unexpected Mechanism
```
[Outcome] works because of [mechanism they don't expect].
```

**Examples:**
- "Semaglutide doesn't burn fat. It changes the conversation between your gut and your brain."
- "Finasteride doesn't grow hair. It stops the hormone that's killing it."
- "ED pills don't create desire. They remove a blood flow bottleneck."
- "Tretinoin doesn't just treat acne. It reprograms how your skin cells turn over."

### Formula 5: The Timeline Truth
```
[Outcome] takes [specific timeframe]. Here's what actually happens.
```

**Examples:**
- "Hair regrowth takes 6-12 months. Here's what's happening under the surface during those invisible weeks."
- "Weight loss on GLP-1s starts week one. Meaningful results show up month three. Here's the curve."
- "ED medication works in 30-60 minutes. What happens in your body during that window matters."

### Formula 6: The Comparison Setup
```
[Option A] vs [Option B]: [The real question you should ask].
```

**Examples:**
- "Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide: The question isn't which is stronger. It's which your body tolerates."
- "Finasteride vs. Minoxidil: One stops loss, one promotes growth. Most men need both."
- "Sildenafil vs. Tadalafil: Daily vs. as-needed isn't about convenience. It's about lifestyle."

### Formula 7: The Policy Hook (for cannabis/regulatory content)
```
[What just changed]. [What it means]. [What happens next].
```

**Examples:**
- "Marijuana just moved to Schedule III. It's not legalization — but it changes everything for research, taxes, and access."
- "Trump signed an executive order on cannabis. Here's what actually happens now (and what doesn't)."
- "40 states have medical marijuana. The federal government finally acknowledged it. What's different?"

### Formula 8: The Personal Stakes
```
If you're [situation], [this is what you need to know].
```

**Examples:**
- "If you've tried dieting and failed, your biology might be working against you. Here's what that means."
- "If you're noticing more hair in the drain, timing is everything. Here's why starting early matters."
- "If ED showed up suddenly, it might be telling you something about your heart health."
