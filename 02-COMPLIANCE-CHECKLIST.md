## Compliance Red Flags

**STOP and revise if content includes:**

🚨 Before/after photos without "results not typical"
🚨 Specific weight loss numbers as promises
🚨 "Doctor recommended" without actual doctor
🚨 Testimonials presented as typical outcomes
🚨 Time-bound guarantees ("lose 20 lbs in 30 days")
🚨 Comparative claims against competitors
🚨 Off-label use promotion
🚨 Diagnosis without consultation

---

## Escalation

**If unsure about a claim:**
1. Default to more conservative language
2. Add citation if claim is important
3. Flag for legal/compliance review if high-risk topic
4. When in doubt, cut it out

**High-risk topics requiring extra review:**
- Controlled substances
- Mental health claims
- Pediatric anything
- Pregnancy/fertility
- Cancer (never claim treatment)
- Specific disease cure claims
