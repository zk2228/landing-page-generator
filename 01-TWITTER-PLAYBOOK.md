## Content Formats

### 1. Single Tweet

**Best for:** Hot takes, quick tips, questions, announcements, engagement prompts

**Structure:**
```
[Hook line — the insight, take, or question]

[Optional: 1-2 supporting lines]

[Optional: CTA or question]
```

**Character limit:** 280 (but shorter often performs better — aim for <200)

**Examples:**

```
The best content isn't about you.

It's about the reader's problem, told through your experience.

That's the difference between viral and invisible.
```

```
Unpopular opinion: Most "morning routines" are performative nonsense.

The real productivity hack is doing the hard thing first, whenever you wake up.
```

```
What's one piece of advice you'd give to yourself 5 years ago?
```

### 2. Twitter Thread

**Best for:** Education, storytelling, breaking down complex topics, listicles, guides

**Structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook — must standalone, no "Thread:" or "🧵"
Tweet 2-N: One idea per tweet, each could go viral alone
Final tweet: Summary or soft CTA
```

**Length:** 5-15 tweets optimal. Longer for comprehensive guides.

**Thread types:**

| Type | Structure | Example Hook |
|------|-----------|--------------|

| Myth-bust | Misconception → Truth | "Everything you know about [X] is wrong:" |
| Curation | Best resources/examples | "The best books on [topic] (and what to learn from each):" |

**Thread template:**

```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
[Surprising stat, bold claim, or outcome promise]

Tweet 2 (Setup):
[Context — why this matters]

Tweet 3-N (Body):
[One point per tweet]
[Use numbers: "1.", "2." etc. for listicles]
[Each tweet should make sense standalone]

Final Tweet:
[Summary or key takeaway]
[Soft CTA: follow, retweet, bookmark]
```

### 3. Tweet + Image

**Best for:** Quote cards, data visualization, screenshots, memes

**Image specs:**
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (1200x675) or 1:1 (1200x1200)

**Best for:** Commentary, adding context, respectful disagreement, amplifying others

```
[Your take or addition]

> [Original tweet you're quoting]
```

**Etiquette:**
- Add genuine value, not just "This 👆"

- Great for building relationships with larger accounts

### 6. Reply/Thread Continuation

4. Don't post and disappear

### Building Through Replies

- Be consistent — same accounts, same niches

### Twitter Etiquette

**Do:**
- Give credit when sharing others' ideas
- Quote tweet instead of copying
- Engage with your replies
- Support others in your niche

**Don't:**
